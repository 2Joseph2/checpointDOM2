## HTML Setup

1. Created a `<div>` element with an `id` of `color-box`. This will represent the box whose color will change.
2. Added a `<button>` element with an `id` of `change-color-btn`. The button should have the text "Change Color".

## Styling with CSS

Created a `styles.css` file for basic styling of the `color-box` and the `change-color-btn`.

## JavaScript for Interactivity

Created a `script.js` file to handle the button click event and change the color of the `color-box`.
